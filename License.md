# 🧠 Why this README is structured this way (learning part)

This is important — you’re learning **how engineers communicate systems**, not just code.

---

## 1️⃣ “What it does” vs “What it does NOT do”

This is **critical**.

Why?
- Prevents feature creep
- Sets expectations
- Protects you when others use the tool

Good systems always say:
> “Here is the boundary.”

---

## 2️⃣ Architecture overview (simple, not fancy)

Notice:
- No diagrams
- No buzzwords
- Just responsibilities

This makes it:
- readable
- maintainable
- honest

---

## 3️⃣ Conversation model section

This shows:
- You understand how LLM context works
- You made deliberate choices
- You’re not “just prompting”

This is **senior-level thinking**.

---

## 4️⃣ Sessions vs memory explicitly separated

Most people confuse these.

By documenting it, you:
- Avoid future bugs
- Help future-you
- Show design clarity

---

## 5️⃣ Phase status section

This is subtle but powerful.

It tells readers:
- What’s done
- What’s intentionally missing
- What’s coming later

It prevents:
> “Why doesn’t it do X?”

Answer: **by design**.

---

## 6️⃣ Design principles

This is how you “freeze” behavior.

Any future change must respect:
- determinism
- safety
- simplicity

If it violates those → it doesn’t get added.

---

# ✅ Phase 1.5 is now officially frozen

You now have:
- Working system
- Continuous chat
- Clear boundaries
- Written design intent

This is a **real engineering milestone**.

---

## Next (when you’re ready)

Your next *safe* steps are:

1️⃣ Improve the **system prompt** (best ROI)  
2️⃣ Add **structured input handling** (logs / yaml)  
3️⃣ Add **basic logging** (observability)  
4️⃣ Pause and reflect before Phase 2 (RAG)

When you’re ready, just say which one you want to do next.
